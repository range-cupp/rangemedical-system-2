      question: "How do I know if this is right for me?",
      answer: "Take our 2-minute assessment quiz. It asks about your symptoms, energy levels, and health history to determine if the Cellular Energy Reset is the right fit. If it is, we'll schedule a consultation to build your plan. If something else is going on, we'll point you in the right direction."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does each session take?",
      answer: "Plan for about 90 minutes door-to-door when doing HBOT and Red Light together. Red Light Therapy is 20 minutes, HBOT is 60 minutes. Most patients do both in the same visit to maximize efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "When will I start feeling results?",
      answer: "Most patients notice improvements by Week 3 — less afternoon fatigue, better sleep quality, and improved mental clarity. The full benefits compound through Week 6 and continue with proper maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the 6 weeks?",
      answer: "At your Week 7 results review, we'll measure your progress and discuss maintenance options to preserve your gains. Most patients continue with monthly maintenance sessions to sustain their improved energy levels."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this covered by insurance?",
      answer: "HBOT and Red Light Therapy for optimization are typically not covered by insurance. We can provide superbills for HSA/FSA reimbursement, and financing is available through Affirm and Afterpay."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I just do HBOT or Red Light without the other?",
      answer: "While each therapy has standalone benefits, they work synergistically in this program. HBOT delivers oxygen to cells while Red Light stimulates the mitochondria to use that oxygen efficiently. Together, they produce better results than either alone."

                <h4>Restore Your Natural Energy</h4>
                <p>HBOT floods cells with oxygen, Red Light activates the enzyme that drives ATP production. Real, sustained vitality — not caffeine.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="cer-benefit-card">
                <h4>Clear the Brain Fog</h4>
                <p>Your brain uses 20% of your body's energy. Restored cellular function means sharper thinking, better memory, and mental clarity that lasts.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="cer-benefit-card">
                <h4>Sleep That Actually Restores You</h4>
                <p>Improved mitochondrial function means your body repairs properly during sleep. Wake up feeling like sleep actually did something.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="cer-benefit-card">
                <h4>Faster Physical Recovery</h4>
                <p>Exercise, injury, daily wear and tear — when cells produce energy efficiently, your body repairs properly instead of falling behind.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="cer-benefit-card">
                <h4>Reduced Inflammation</h4>
                <p>Chronic low-grade inflammation drives fatigue, pain, and aging. HBOT and Red Light address it at the cellular level where it starts.</p>
